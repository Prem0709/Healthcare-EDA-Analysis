# 🚀 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Healthcare 🏥📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** in the healthcare domain, specifically analyzing heart disease data. The goal is to uncover valuable insights that can aid in better understanding risk factors and trends in patient health data.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset used for this analysis is **heart.csv**, containing various patient health parameters.
- It includes attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
✔️ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, detecting outliers, and ensuring consistency.  
✔️ **Univariate, Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis** – Understanding individual and relational data distributions.  
✔️ **Statistical & Visual Insights** – Using Python libraries like **Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib** for effective data visualization.  
✔️ **Actionable Findings** – Extracting meaningful insights to support healthcare decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** 📊
- **Seaborn & Matplotlib** 🎨
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓

## 📊 Visualizations & Analysis
This project includes:
- Histograms, boxplots, and distribution plots for **univariate analysis**.
- Scatter plots and correlation matrices for **bivariate & multivariate analysis**.
- Outlier detection and handling methods.
